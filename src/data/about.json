    "text1": "Companies seeking to offset CO2 emissions with carbon credits need to source high-quality carbon, or risk accusations of greenwashing. A common approach has been to trust in centralized carbon registries e.g. Verra, Gold Standard, but blind trust in brand names has proven a poor guarantee of quality.",
