    "text1": "Companies offsetting CO2 emissions with carbon credits need to procure high-quality carbon, or risk accusations of greenwashing. A common approach is to trust in centralized carbon registries (e.g. Verra, Gold Standard) but blind trust in brand names has proven to be a poor guarantee of quality.",
