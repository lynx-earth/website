    "text1": "Lynx utilizes satellite remote-sensing and blockchain technologies to digitize the supply-side of carbon credits, providing traceability for each tonne of CO2 back to the source, increasing buyer trust and reducing the need for costly manual monitoring and verification.",
    "text2": "Listing a carbon sequestration project with a major registry is cost-feasible only for large-scale projects. Smaller players are deprived of the economic benefits of participating in voluntary carbon markets. Lynx's solution for rice paddy methane reduction, makes it possible to work directly with small-holder rice farmers in Japan and internationally."
