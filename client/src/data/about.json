    "text1": "Listing a carbon sequestration project with one of the major registries commonly requires an up-front investment of USD$100,000 or more, making it cost-effective for only the largest of projects.

Unlike other blockchain-based carbon platforms, each tonne is uniquely tracked, fully traceable to the original source."
